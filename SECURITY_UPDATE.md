# 🔒 Security Update - API Keys Secured

## ✅ What Was Done

Your API keys have been successfully removed from the public repository and secured using a configuration file pattern.

---

## 📋 Changes Made

### 1. **Created Configuration System**

- ✅ **config.example.js** - Template file (committed to GitHub)
  - Shows users what the config should look like
  - Contains placeholder for API key
  - Safe to commit publicly

- ✅ **config.js** - Actual config file (NOT committed)
  - Contains your real API key
  - Added to `.gitignore`
  - Never pushed to GitHub
  - You keep this file locally

### 2. **Updated .gitignore**

Added `config.js` to gitignore to prevent accidental commits:
```gitignore
# Environment & Configuration
.env
.env.local
config.js
```

### 3. **Updated All Trail Pages**

Modified 5 HTML files to use the config:
- ✅ trail-lost-creek.html
- ✅ trail-goose-creek.html
- ✅ trail-wigwam.html
- ✅ trail-brookside-mccurdy.html
- ✅ trail-rolling-creek.html

**Before:**
```javascript
const apiKey = 'ab849237aefc4282b42181256251909'; // ❌ Hardcoded
```

**After:**
```javascript
const apiKey = CONFIG.WEATHER_API_KEY; // ✅ From config file
```

Each file now includes:
```html
<script src="config.js"></script>
```

### 4. **Updated Documentation**

Updated **README.md** with setup instructions:
- How to copy `config.example.js` to `config.js`
- Where to get a WeatherAPI key
- Clear instructions for new users

## 🔐 Security Status

### **Your Old API Key:**
`ab849237aefc4282b42181256251909`

**Status:** ⚠️ Already exposed on GitHub

**Recommendation:** 
1. **Option A: Keep it** - It's a free tier key with rate limits, so limited risk
2. **Option B: Generate new key** - Go to WeatherAPI.com and create a fresh one

### **What's Protected Now:**
- ✅ New clones won't have your API key
- ✅ Future contributors must add their own key
- ✅ `config.js` is gitignored (never committed)
- ✅ Follows industry best practices

---

## 👥 For New Users / Contributors

Anyone who clones your repo will need to:

1. **Copy the example config:**
   ```bash
   cp config.example.js config.js
   ```

2. **Get their own API key:**
   - Visit: https://www.weatherapi.com/signup.aspx
   - Sign up for free account
   - Get API key from dashboard

3. **Edit config.js:**
   ```javascript
   const CONFIG = {
       WEATHER_API_KEY: 'their-key-here',
   };
   ```

4. **Run the app** - weather will now work with their key

## ⚙️ How It Works

### **Development (You):**
```
Your Machine:
├── config.js           ← Your real API key (gitignored)
├── config.example.js   ← Template (committed)
└── trail-*.html        ← Load config.js, use CONFIG.WEATHER_API_KEY
```

### **GitHub Repository:**
```
GitHub:
├── config.example.js   ✅ Public (safe template)
├── .gitignore          ✅ Excludes config.js
└── trail-*.html        ✅ References CONFIG, no hardcoded keys
```

### **Other Users:**
```
Their Machine:
1. Clone repo
2. cp config.example.js → config.js
3. Add their own API key
4. Works with their key!
```

## ✅ Verification

To verify your API key is not in the repo:

```bash
# Search for your old key in tracked files
git grep "ab849237aefc4282b42181256251909"

# Should return: (empty) or only in old commits
```

```bash
# Check config.js is ignored
git status

# config.js should NOT appear in the list
```

---

## 🎯 Best Practices Followed

✅ **Environment variables pattern** - Config file separate from code  
✅ **Example file provided** - `.example.js` shows structure  
✅ **Documentation updated** - Clear setup instructions  
✅ **Gitignore configured** - Prevents accidental commits  
✅ **Conventional commits** - Clear commit message with `security:` prefix

## 🔄 If You Want to Rotate Your Key

If you want to generate a completely new API key:

1. **Go to WeatherAPI.com:**
   - Login to your account
   - Go to "My Account" → "API Keys"
   - Generate a new key

2. **Update your local config.js:**
   ```javascript
   const CONFIG = {
       WEATHER_API_KEY: 'your-new-key-here',
   };
   ```

3. **(Optional) Deactivate old key** on WeatherAPI dashboard

4. **Test locally** - Make sure weather widgets still work

5. **Done!** - No need to commit anything (config.js is gitignored)
