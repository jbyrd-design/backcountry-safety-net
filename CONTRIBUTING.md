## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Modern web browser
- Text editor/IDE

### Local Development

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/backcountry-safety-net.git
   cd backcountry-safety-net
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Follow coding standards (see below)
   - Test thoroughly
   - Update documentation

4. **Test locally**
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   # Visit http://localhost:8000
   ```

5. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

---

## Coding Standards

### Python (server.py)

- Follow **PEP 8** style guide
- Use type hints where applicable
- Add docstrings to all functions
- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Use meaningful variable names

**Example:**
```python
def get_trail_risk(elevation: float, slope: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate risk score based on terrain factors.
    
    Args:
        elevation: Trail elevation in feet
        slope: Average slope in degrees
    
    Returns:
        Risk score from 0.0 to 4.0
    """
    # Implementation
```

### JavaScript (app.js)

- Use **ES6+ syntax**
- Consistent 4-space indentation
- Semicolons required
- Use `const` and `let`, avoid `var`
- Add JSDoc comments for functions

**Example:**
```javascript
/**
 * Initialize map with trail data
 * @param {number} lat - Latitude of center point
 * @param {number} lon - Longitude of center point
 */
function initializeMap(lat, lon) {
    // Implementation
}
```

### HTML/CSS

- Semantic HTML5 elements
- BEM-inspired CSS naming
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Accessibility attributes (ARIA labels)

### Data Standards

- All coordinates in decimal degrees (WGS84)
- Elevations in feet
- Distances in miles
- Proper USGS data attribution
- Cite all external data sources

## Data Attribution

### Required Citations

When adding new trails or data:

1. **USGS Data**
   - Source: USGS 3D Elevation Program
   - Quad name and date
   - Example: `USGS Lost Park Quadrangle (1994)`

2. **Trail Data**
   - Source: USFS or COTREX
   - Last updated date
   - Example: `USFS Pike-San Isabel NF (2024)`

3. **Weather Data**
   - Always maintain WeatherAPI.com attribution
   - Include last updated timestamp

### Data Quality Standards

- Verify elevation data against USGS sources
- Cross-reference trail distances with official sources
- Document data collection methodology
- Include margin of error where applicable
